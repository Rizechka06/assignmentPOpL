  //Implementing a Date Class in Java//

This code is like, it makes a 'Date' thing. You know, like when is your birthday? It keeps track of the day, the month, and the year.
here's a part that checks if your date is even real. Like, you can't have month number 13.
Then, it can change the date if you want. It can update it.
It can also show you the date in a way you can read, like "January the 1st, 2023".

Finally, there's a part that knows how to put a bunch of these date things in order. Like, from the earliest birthday to the latest.
It's like lining up your toys from smallest to biggest, but with dates!
The bottom part of the code just shows you how to use all these date. It makes some dates, checks if they're okay,
changes one, asks what day it was, sees how far apart they are, and puts a bunch in order. Easy peasy!

Code: This code has two classes Main and Date. There are Date(constructor), isValidDate, updateDate, getDayOfWeek(this method calculate day of week),
calculateDifference, toDays(it finds total days in a year), printDate, isLeapYear, 
compareTo(sort list first by year, then by month, and finally by day) methods. Then public class Main has data to show how work all of these methods.
